# Using Scholars Portal Books Accounts

Creating a Scholars Portal Books account allows you to make and save book lists, and to annotate, highlight, and take notes as you read. You can log in to your Books account from the top right-hand side of every page:

Queens, Guelph, Toronto, Ottawa, Windsor, and York currently support Shibboleth one step login for Books:

This means that your SP Books account is linked to your library credentials, and signing in to your account will also allow you to access subscribed content. 

If you're at a school that does not yet support this process, you can create an account using your Google, Facebook, Twitter, or OpenID credentials. If you're off-campus you will also have to sign in with your library credentials to access content.

An account's library contains marked and saved records, as well as all annotations made to a text:
